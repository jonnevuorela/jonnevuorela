## Hello!

I'm an **ICT Engineering student** at **Lapland University of Applied Sciences** with a subtle interest in backend development. Iâ€™m still exploring and learning, and I prefer to pick up specific technologies as I encounter them in different projects. Right now, I'm focused on expanding my understanding on different technologies and just building stuff.
Most significant of my coding projects are composed and displayed in <a href="https://jonnevuorela.github.io/portfolio.html">here</a>.
