## Hello!

I'm an **Software Engineering student** at **Lapland University of Applied Sciences** with a goal to better myself in backend development. I prefer to pick up specific technologies as I encounter them and if I like them, maybe try them out in different projects. Right now, I'm focused on expanding my understanding on different technologies and just building stuff.
Most significant of my coding projects are composed and displayed in <a href="https://jonnevuorela.github.io/portfolio.html">here</a>.
